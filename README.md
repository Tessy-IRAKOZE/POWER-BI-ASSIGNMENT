##  Project Overview

This Power BI project focuses on analyzing Uber trip data to extract meaningful insights and trends. The goal is to transform raw trip data into a series of clear, interactive visualizations that explore fare dynamics, trip distances, time-based patterns, and other key performance metrics.
---
##  Data Source

- The analysis is based on a dataset containing detailed Uber trip records.
- Data was cleaned, transformed, and modeled in **Power BI Desktop**.
- The `.pbix` file (`TESSY.pbix`) contains the complete report, queries, visuals, and data model.

##  Key Analysis Areas

The report is organized into multiple pages, each focused on a specific angle of analysis:

### 1. **Data Overview**
Provides basic statistics and a look at the raw structure of the dataset to understand the starting point of the analysis.

### 2. **Data Information & Types**
Shows data types and non-null counts for each column to assess data quality and completeness.

### 3. **Fare Amount Analysis by Hour**
Visualizes how fare prices vary throughout the day to highlight peak revenue hours.

### 4. **Trip Distance Analysis**
Displays the distribution of trip distances, pointing out frequent trip lengths and outliers.

### 5. **Fare Amount Distribution**
Analyzes the spread of fare prices across all trips to identify pricing patterns and potential anomalies.

### 6. **Fare Amount by Weekday**
Compares fare activity across the days of the week, identifying busy periods and weekly trends.
